# Welcome!
## Purpose
This repository was created to accommodate my first project for stats 220 at the University of Auckland lead by Anna Fergusson.
Here are some reasons I like her class (I was ****not**** held at _gunpoint_ to write this list):
* She cultivates a wholesome and inclusive environment
* The stats app exercises are interactive and entertaining
* My good friend Jadon Chu sits next to me
To my critics of this last point:
1. This is my project not yours
2. There is no reason why I should exclude this truth for the fear of informality
3. Don't be sad; I'll be your friend
## About me
I am a young gun and interested in building up a diverse and efficient toolbox of skills in the field of data science. I have a logical mind and love building models and such to most effectively order the chaos and "clouds of probabilities" around me. I am a Christian and in my free time you'll find me grinding the chess and the rainbow six.
